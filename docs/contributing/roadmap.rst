Roadmap
=======

Shibuya will be my (lepture_) default Sphinx theme for my Python projects. It is
far from perfect now. I have many plans on this theme. Here lists some goals in
my mind.

.. _lepture: https://github.com/lepture

Perfect on RTD
--------------

Make it perfect look on RTD, which means I'll design on:

- Ethical Ads
- Versions display

Design for other extensions
---------------------------

Make sure it works well with other extensions. Currently integrated with:

- `sphinx-copybutton <https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/>`_

Instant search
--------------

When searching in the search input, show a popup with instant results.
This could be done by calling the search script manually.
