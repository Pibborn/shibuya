Roadmap
=======

Shibuya will be my (lepture_) default Sphinx theme for my Python projects.
It is still far from perfect. I have many plans for this theme. Here are
some goals I have in mind.

.. _lepture: https://github.com/lepture

Perfect on RTD
--------------

Make it perfect look on RTD, which means I'll design on:

- :bdg-success:`DONE` Ethical Ads
- :bdg-success:`DONE` Pretty versions display

Good to have
------------

These good things will be added in the future:

- :bdg-info:`WIP` Perfect code highlight style
- :bdg-success:`DONE` Edit this page link
- :bdg-success:`DONE` GitHub stars and forks
- :bdg-warning:`TODO` Scroll to top
- :bdg-success:`DONE` Breadcrumbs

Design for other extensions
---------------------------

Make sure it works well with other extensions. Currently integrated with:

- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`sphinx-copybutton`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`sphinx-tabs`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`sphinx-design`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`sphinx-jupyter`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`sphinx-togglebutton`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`nbsphinx`
- :bdg-success:`DONE` :ref:`numpydoc`

Instant search
--------------

When searching in the search input, show a popup with instant results.
This could be done by calling the search script manually.
