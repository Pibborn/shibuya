Roadmap
=======

Shibuya will be my (lepture_) default Sphinx theme for my Python projects.
It is still far from perfect. I have many plans for this theme. Here are
some goals I have in mind.

.. _lepture: https://github.com/lepture

Perfect on RTD
--------------

Make it perfect look on RTD, which means I'll design on:

- **DONE**: Ethical Ads
- **DONE**: Pretty versions display

Good to have
------------

These good things will be added in the future:

- Perfect code highlight style
- **DONE**: Edit this page link
- GitHub stars and forks
- Scroll to top

Design for other extensions
---------------------------

Make sure it works well with other extensions. Currently integrated with:

- **DONE**: `sphinx-copybutton <https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/>`_
- **DONE**: `sphinx-tabs <https://sphinx-tabs.readthedocs.io/>`_
- **WIP**: `sphinx-design <https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/>`_

Instant search
--------------

When searching in the search input, show a popup with instant results.
This could be done by calling the search script manually.
