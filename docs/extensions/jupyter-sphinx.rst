:description: Shibuya Sphinx theme has special design for Jupyter sphinx extension.

.. _sphinx-jupyter:

jupyter-sphinx
==============

Jupyter-sphinx is a Sphinx extension that executes embedded code
in a Jupyter kernel, and embeds outputs of that code in the document.

- **Documentation**: https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io/
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-sphinx

Install
-------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jupyter-sphinx

Then, add the extension to your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: conf.py

    extensions = [
        # ...
        "jupyter_sphinx",
    ]

If you encounter this error:

.. code-block:: none

    Unable to find kernel (exception: No such kernel named python3)

Try to install ``ipykernel``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ipykernel

Usage
-----

You can use the ``jupyter-execute`` directive to embed code into the document::

  .. jupyter-execute::

    name = 'world'
    print('hello ' + name + '!')

The above is rendered as follows:

.. jupyter-execute::

  name = 'world'
  print('hello ' + name + '!')

Note that the code produces *output* (printing the string 'hello world!'), and the output
is rendered directly after the code snippet.

Because all code cells in a document are run in the same kernel, cells later in the document
can use variables and functions defined in cells earlier in the document:

.. jupyter-execute::

    a = 1
    print('first cell: a = {}'.format(a))

.. jupyter-execute::

    a += 1
    print('second cell: a = {}'.format(a))

Because ``jupyter-sphinx`` uses the machinery of ``nbconvert``, it is capable of rendering any rich output, for example plots:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot
    %matplotlib inline

    x = np.linspace(1E-3, 2 * np.pi)

    pyplot.plot(x, np.sin(x) / x)
    pyplot.plot(x, np.cos(x))
    pyplot.grid()

LaTeX output:

.. jupyter-execute::

  from IPython.display import Latex
  Latex('\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-xÂ²}dx = \sqrt{\pi}')

or even full-blown javascript widgets:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import ipywidgets as w
    from IPython.display import display

    a = w.IntSlider()
    b = w.IntText()
    w.jslink((a, 'value'), (b, 'value'))
    display(a, b)

It is also possible to include code from a regular file by passing the filename as argument
to ``jupyter-execute``::

  .. jupyter-execute:: some_code.py

``jupyter-execute`` may also be used in docstrings within your Python code, and will be executed
when they are included with Sphinx autodoc.


Directive options
-----------------
You may choose to hide the code of a cell, but keep its output visible using ``:hide-code:``::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :hide-code:

      print('this code is invisible')

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    print('this code is invisible')

this option is particularly useful if you want to embed correctness checks in building your documentation::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :hide-code:

      assert everything_works, "There's a bug somewhere"

This way even though the code won't make it into the documentation, the build will fail if running the code fails.

Similarly, outputs are hidden with ``:hide-output:``::

    .. jupyter-execute::
        :hide-output:

        print('this output is invisible')

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-output:

    print('this output is invisible')

You may also display the code *below* the output with ``:code-below:``::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :code-below:

      print('this code is below the output')

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :code-below:

    print('this code is below the output')

You may also add *line numbers* to the source code with ``:linenos:``::

  .. jupyter-execute::
     :linenos:

     print('A')
     print('B')
     print('C')

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :linenos:

    print('A')
    print('B')
    print('C')

To add *line numbers from a specific line* to the source code, use the
``lineno-start`` directive::

  .. jupyter-execute::
     :lineno-start: 7

     print('A')
     print('B')
     print('C')

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :lineno-start: 7

    print('A')
    print('B')
    print('C')

You may also emphasize particular lines in the source code with ``:emphasize-lines:``::

    .. jupyter-execute::
        :emphasize-lines: 2,5-6

        d = {
            'a': 1,
            'b': 2,
            'c': 3,
            'd': 4,
            'e': 5,
        }

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :lineno-start: 2
    :emphasize-lines: 2,5-6

    d = {
        'a': 1,
        'b': 2,
        'c': 3,
        'd': 4,
        'e': 5,
    }

Controlling exceptions
----------------------

The default behaviour when jupyter-sphinx encounters an error in the embedded code is just to
stop execution of the document and display a stack trace. However, there are many cases where it may be
illustrative for execution to continue and for a stack trace to be shown as *output of the cell*. This
behaviour can be enabled by using the ``raises`` option::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :raises:

      1 / 0

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :raises:

    1 / 0

Note that when given no arguments, ``raises`` will catch all errors. It is also possible to give ``raises``
a list of error types; if an error is raised that is not in the list then execution stops as usual::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :raises: KeyError, ValueError

      a = {'hello': 'world!'}
      a['jello']

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
  :raises: KeyError, ValueError

  a = {'hello': 'world!'}
  a['jello']

Additionally, any output sent to the ``stderr`` stream of a cell will result in jupyter-sphinx
producing a warning. This behaviour can be suppressed (and the ``stderr`` stream printed as regular
output) by providing the ``stderr`` option::

  .. jupyter-execute::
      :stderr:

      import sys

      print("hello, world!", file=sys.stderr)

produces:

.. jupyter-execute::
    :stderr:

    import sys

    print("hello, world!", file=sys.stderr)

Manually forming Jupyter cells
------------------------------

When showing code samples that are computationally expensive, access restricted resources, or have non-deterministic output, it can be preferable to not have them run every time you build. You can simply embed input code without executing it using the ``jupyter-input`` directive expected output with ``jupyter-output``::

  .. jupyter-input::
      :linenos:

      import time

      def slow_print(str):
          time.sleep(4000)    # Simulate an expensive process
          print(str)

      slow_print("hello, world!")

  .. jupyter-output::

      hello, world!

produces:

.. jupyter-input::
    :linenos:

    import time

    def slow_print(str):
        time.sleep(4000)    # Simulate an expensive process
        print(str)

    slow_print("hello, world!")

.. jupyter-output::

    hello, world!
