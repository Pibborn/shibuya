:description: Stability policy for Shibuya Sphinx theme updates and releases.

Stability Policy
================

As Shibuya Theme is intended to be a professional theme rather than a hobby one,
it is important to keep it stable. Users who use Shibuya Theme in a standard way
should not expect any disruptive changes with each upgrade. That's not to say that
there won't be occasional glitches.

Design changes
--------------

Shibuya Theme may make minor design changes or add new features in each release.
But the layout is fixed, it is divided into three parts:

- **header**: designed to be compatible with most company or product homepages
- **body**: left sidebar for document links, main content and right sidebar
  for table of contents
- **footer**: additional information and links about your company or product

Sphinx versions
---------------

Here lists the Sphinx version Shibuya theme supports:

- Sphinx v6
- Sphinx v7
- Sphinx v8

Shibuya Theme may drop support for older versions of Sphinx when
a new version of Sphinx is released.

Undocumented features
---------------------

Shibuya Theme may contain undocumented features, the stability
of these undocumented features is not guaranteed.

Pin the version
---------------

The best solution for stability is to pin the version to your requirements
file. If there is a new release of Shibuya Theme, check the changelog first
before upgrading.
