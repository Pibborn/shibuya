Text Markups
============

This article is a demo of what the typography of Shibuya looks like.

Inline markups
--------------

Content can have inline markup like *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**,
and ``inline code``. Also, a subscript and superscript can be
written with:

.. code-block:: rst

   :sub:`text in subscript`

   :sup:`text in superscript`

- A subscript looks like :sub:`text in subscript`
- A superscript looks like :sup:`text in superscript`

.. container:: demo

   .. code-block:: rst
      :caption: links
      :class: demo-code

      In Sphinx, link is called reference. There are many ways to create
      a reference. For instance :pep:`8` is generated by ``:pep:`8```. In
      general, it is just a link_.

.. container:: demo

   .. code-block:: rst
      :caption: abbreviations
      :class: demo-code

      You can also include abbreviations like
      :abbr:`HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)`.

   .. container:: demo-result

      :abbr:`HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)`.

Block quote
-----------

    If you are familiar with Markdown, blockquote in reStructuredText
    looks like indented code in Markdown.

It is also possible to add attribution to the quote:

    "It is my business to know things.  That is my trade."

    -- Sherlock Holmes

Lists
-----

And unlike Markdown, reStructuredText has no tight list. For example:

.. code-block:: rst

  - List item 1
  - List item 2

- List item 1
- List item 2

If you inspect the HTML in your browser, you will find there are always
``<p>`` tag in the list.

Here is a more complex list demo:

- A list

  - can contain another list

    1. there are ordered list
    2. and unordered list

- The unordered list

  a. can have different style
  b. this ordered list is using ``a``, ``b``, etc
  c. instead of numbers

Bellow is a ``<hr>`` tag, created by ``----``.

Definition lists
----------------

.. code-block:: rst

   Term
      The definition of the term.
   Apple
      A kind of fruit, not a company.

Term
   The definition of term.
Apple
   A kind of fruit, not a company.
