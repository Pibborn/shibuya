Markups
=======

This article is a demo of what the typography of Shibuya looks like.
You will learn the syntax of reStructuredText, and to see the rendered
result of each markup.

Emphasis
--------

Content can have inline markup like *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**,
and ``inline code``.

- ``*emphasis*`` is usually in an *italic* style
- ``**strong emphasis**`` is usually in a **bold** style

Inline code
-----------

An inline code is surrounded by double ``backticks``::

Subscript and Superscript
-------------------------

A :sub:`subscript` and :sup:`superscript` can be written with:

.. code-block:: rst

   :sub:`text in subscript`

   :sup:`text in superscript`

- A subscript looks like :sub:`text in subscript`
- A superscript looks like :sup:`text in superscript`

Links
-----

.. code-block:: rst
  :caption: links
  :class: demo-code

  In Sphinx, link is called reference. There are many ways to create
  a reference. For instance :pep:`8` is generated by ``:pep:`8```. In
  general, it is just a link_.

Block quote
-----------

    If you are familiar with Markdown, blockquote in reStructuredText
    looks like indented code in Markdown.

It is also possible to add attribution to the quote:

    I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.

    -- Albert Einstein

.. code-block:: rst
