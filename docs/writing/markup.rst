Text Markups
============


Content can have inline markup like *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**,
``inline literals``, :sub:`subscript`, :sup:`superscript` and so much more.
Providing a reference to :pep:`8` is straightforward. You can also include
abbreviations like :abbr:`HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)`.

    This is blockquoted text.

It is possible to have multiple paragraphs of text, which get separated
from each other visually. When stronger visual separation is desired, a
horizontal separator can be used (4 or more punctuation characters on a line).
